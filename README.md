## Mobile Application Project for 4th Semester

### Kotlin / Compose

Demonstrated in this repo is a not-quite-working demonstration of a mobile messaging app using the fundamental systems required for the Sault College Mobile Applications course.

The following systems were implemented over the course of 5 labs:

- Gradle Dependencies and IDE setup
- Data Types / Unit Testing
- UI / Instrument Testing
- Datastores (Pref / Proto)
- Databases and Daos (Room)

It is currently incomplete and non-functional but this may change over time as a personal development project.
